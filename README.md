This paper proposed an explainable ensemble machine learning framework, XEMLPD, designed to provide both global and local interpretability in PD diagnosis while maintaining high predictive accuracy. Several ensemble machine learning (EML) models—boosting, bagging, stacking, and voting—were evaluated, with optimized features selected using techniques such as SelectedKBest, mRMR, PCA, and LDA. Among these, the stacking model combined with LDA feature optimization consistently delivered the highest accuracy. To ensure transparency, we integrated explainable AI methods—SHapley Adaptive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)—into the stacking model.
